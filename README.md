## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @trihoang1810
I build things for the web and mobile. My major is Automation Engineering.
I have some works that I have done before. You can check out at: [Spotify Visualization](https://your-spotify-profile.herokuapp.com/), [Jamizy](https://jamizy.netlify.app/)...

## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m also interested in IoT and how we can apply them to our life efficiently.
I have built an app for mobile that can track the parameters of a particular machine using Flutter Framework and a supervisory control and data acquisition web-application using ReactJS in C.H.A JSC.

_Note_: **ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced React that can help me to build both web app and mobile app**
